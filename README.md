# Empathetic Code Reviewer (Mission 1)

Turn blunt code review comments into empathetic, constructive, educational feedback.

## What this solves (short)
Code reviews often feel harsh or unclear. This tool rewrites direct/critical comments into:
- **Positive Rephrasing**
- **The Why** (principle behind the suggestion)
- **Suggested Improvement** (code example)

It outputs a clean **Markdown report** you can share.
